[Samosa], does it need any introduction? I don’t think so!
Because samosa is so so common in India (you literally get samosa and tea/chai at every other street
corner), I always considered it to be a quintessential Indian delicacy.

Aloo [Samosa] is the most
popular snack back home. I specially like the crispy and less spicy version!

One of few advantages of COVID-19 quarantine have been the amount of time I have been getting in
the kitchen. This weekend I tried my hand at making Aloo/potatoes Samosa in my kitchen!

So, here is my simplified version of Aloo Samosa recipe!

### Samosa Filling

- Boil potatoes until they are soft, for roughly 12-15 minutes
- Crumble the potatoes with your fingers so you have a few lumps

- Saute the ginger for 30 seconds, and then add rest of the spices, stir to mix
- Add peanuts, if using them!
- Add potatoes, and peas and stir-fry until the peas are tender and the mixture is very dry,
  about two to three minutes
- Add salt to taste
- Turn off the heat and let the filling cool slightly

### Making/Frying Samosas

- Divide the dough into 7-8 equal balls.
- Roll out each ball into an oval, about 6 inches long and 4 inches wide. Use some oil to coat the
  countertop if needed to keep the dough from sticking.
- Using a pizza cutter, cut across the long side of the oval to create two semi-circular pieces.
- Coat the edges of each semi-circle with water.
- Pick the two corners and bring them together, edges overlapping, to form a cone. Press down on
  the seam to stick it.
- Inside the cone, add the filling.
- Seal the top of the samosa by pressing.
- Repeat these for all samosas.
- Now, in a wok or a frying pan, heat the vegetable oil for frying the samosas
- Once the temperature reaches 300 F, drop samosas and fry until golden brown!
