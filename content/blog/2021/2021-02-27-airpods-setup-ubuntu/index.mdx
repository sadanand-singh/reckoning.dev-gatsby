If you have apple airpods or airpods pro, and sometimes want to use it with your Ubuntu machines,
follow this guide! If you try to pair airpods without doing any of these steps, most likely the
pairing process will never complete.

This is a compilation of ideas from few askubuntu posts.[^1] [^2]

<Callout type="note">

**Note:** You should use HSP/HFP profile only when you need to use the airpods as microphone for
example to make a zoom or google meet call. The sound quality in this mode can be quite terrible.

</Callout>

To enable pairing of airpods, you will need to update the `ControllerMode` to `bredr` from the
default value of `dual`. This can be done by editing the file `/etc/bluetooth/main.conf`.
Then restart the Bluetooth service using `sudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth restart` command.

You should be able to pair your airpods now and use it as headphones!

## Enabling Airpods as Microphone

In order to have airpods work as microphones, you will need to enable HSP/HFP profile. However,
[Pulseaudio](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/) by default only supports HSP.
In order to make HSP/HFP work, you have to enable HFP on
pulseaudio which needs `ofono`. Here are steps to enable HFP on pulseaudio using ofono on
Ubuntu 20.04.

1. Install `ofono` using: `sudo apt install ofono`

2. Configure pulseaudio to use ofono:

   Goto `/etc/pulse/default.pa`, find the line `load-module module-bluetooth-discover` and change
   it to `load-module module-bluetooth-discover headset=ofono`.

   Add the user `pulse` to group `bluetooth` to grant the permission:
   `sudo usermod -aG bluetooth pulse`

   **VERY IMPORTANT:** To grant the permission, add the following code snippets to
   `/etc/dbus-1/system.d/ofono.conf` (before `</busconfig>`):

   ```xml
   <policy user="pulse">
   <allow send_destination="org.ofono"/>
   </policy>
   ```

3. In order to make ofono work, you have to provide a modem to it!
   You can install a modem emulator called `phonesim` (implemented by `ofono`) to make it work:

   install `ofono-phonesim`:

   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:smoser/bluetooth
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install ofono-phonesim
   ```

   Configure `phonesim` by adding the following lines to `/etc/ofono/phonesim.conf`:

   ```bash
   [phonesim]
   Driver=phonesim
   Address=127.0.0.1
   Port=12345
   ```

   Now, restart `ofono` service as:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart ofono.service
   ```

   Now you will need to define and enable few services to start the `ofono-phonesim` as service.

   To run `ofono-phonesim -p 12345 /usr/share/phonesim/default.xml` on startup as a systemd unit,
   create the file `/etc/systemd/system/ofono-phonesim.service`(as root) with the following
   contents:

   ```bash
   [Unit]
   Description=Run ofono-phonesim in the background

   [Service]

   ExecStart=ofono-phonesim -p 12345 /usr/share/phonesim/default.xml
   Type=simple
   RemainAfterExit=yes

   [Install]

   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

   After ofono-phonesim runs, you'll need to also enable and put the phonesim modem online.

   You will first need to use this githup repo:

   As pointed in comments below, you might need a particular git commit for it to work the way it worked for me. The particular commit that I used the commit
   `b3682c6bab99cbe301fa9bf4a2416c3f730d8bfd` from the repo.

   ```bash
   cd /tmp
   git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/ofono/ofono.git
   git checkout 	b3682c6bab99cbe301fa9bf4a2416c3f730d8bfd
   sudo mv ofono /opt/
   ```

   Now you can enable and make phonesim modem online by creating another `systemd` unit file that
   depends on the above `ofono-phonesim` `systemd` unit. Put the following contents
   in `/etc/systemd/system/phonesim-enable-modem.service`:

   ```bash:title=/etc/systemd/system/phonesim-enable-modem.service
   [Unit]
   Description=Enable and online phonesim modem
   Requires=ofono-phonesim.service

   [Service]

   ExecStart=/opt/ofono/test/enable-modem /phonesim
   ExecStart=/opt/ofono/test/online-modem /phonesim
   Type=oneshot
   RemainAfterExit=yes

   [Install]

   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

   Then run the following commands to run both daemons:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable ofono-phonesim.service
   sudo systemctl enable phonesim-enable-modem.service
   sudo service phonesim-enable-modem start
   ```

   Check if the service is running with

   ```bash
   sudo service phonesim-enable-modem status
   ```

Finally, restart `pulseaudio` with `pulseaudio -k`.

Now you should be able to switch to HSP/HFP profile for airpods and use it as an
input device / microphones.
