Its been quite long since I last made any update to my Desktop at home. After a full year of
working from home, I finally decided to make it more modern.

My old desktop was a [decent workhorse outlined here](/blog/mydlsetup/#workstartion-hardware).

After some thinking I decided to update my CPU to AMD Ryzen 5 3600, instead of another Intel one.
Ever since leaving Intel my trust on their products have been going down at ever alarming rate!

Here is my upgraded configuration:

- [AMD - Ryzen 5 3600 6-Core Processor](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-5-3600)
- [MSI - MPG B550 Gaming Plus Motherboard](https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/MPG-B550-GAMING-PLUS)
- [Corsair - Vengeance RGB PRO 32 GB (4 x 8 GB) DDR4-3200 Memory](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Categories/Products/Memory/Vengeance-PRO-RGB-Black/p/CMW32GX4M4C3200C16)
- [Western Digital - SN750 NVMe SSD](https://shop.westerndigital.com/products/internal-drives/wd-black-sn750-nvme-ssd#WDS250G3X0C)
- [Western Digital - Blue 4 TB 3.5" 5400RPM Internal Hard Drive](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822235011)
- [Nvidia Geforce GTX 1080 Ti](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/products/10series/geforce-gtx-1080-ti/)
- [Cooler Master - MasterCase Pro 5](http://www.coolermaster.com/case/mid-tower/mastercase-5/)
- [Corsair RM750i 750w ATX PSU 80 Plus Gold Fully Modular](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/Power/Plug-Type/rmi-series-config/p/CP-9020082-NA)
- [TP-Link - Archer T9E PCI-Express x1 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi Adapter](https://www.tp-link.com/us/products/details/cat-5519_Archer-T9E.html)
- [Dell UltraSharp 27 4K USB-C Monitor - U2720Q](https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/ultrasharp-27-4k-usb-c-monitor-u2720q/apd/210-avjv/monitors-monitor-accessories)
- [Das 4 Professional Keyboard](https://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4-professional/)
- [Logitech MX Master 3 Mouse](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-master-3-mac-wireless-mouse.910-005693.html)
- [Logitech C505e HD Business Webcam](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/webcams/c505e-business-webcam.960-001385.html?crid=1690)

The main difference from my old desktop is in AMD CPU, WD NVMe SSD, Dell 4K Monitors and new
Logitech MX Master Mouse.

In the next post, I will also add my guide to install Ubuntu on this machine using BTRFS and
luks based full disk encryption.
