[Arch Linux][al] is a general purpose GNU/Linux distribution that provides most up-to-date software
by following the rolling-release model. Arch Linux allows you to use updated cutting-edge software
and packages as soon as the developers released them.

[Plasma 5][plasma5] is the current generation
of the desktop environment created by KDE primarily for Linux systems.

<Callout type='note'>

+ <ProMark /> Please see <Link to='/blog/complete-setup-arch-gnome'>my latest post</Link> on installing Arch linux with Gnome 3 for
an up to date version of this guide.

In this post, we will do a complete installation of Arch Linux with Plasma 5 as the desktop
environment. Our setup will also involve encryption of the root partition that will be formatted in
[btrfs]. This post is an updated and a more complete version of my previous posts on
[Arch Linux](/blog/arch-install) and [Plasma 5 Installation](/blog/plasma-installation).

## Base Installation

<Callout type='note'>

I do not wish to repeat
[Arch Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide) here.

Do not forget about [Arch Wiki][a-wiki], the best documentation in the world! Most of the content
in this post has been compiled from the [Arch Wiki][a-wiki].

[a-wiki]: https://wiki.archlinux.org/

Before beginning this guide, I would assume that you have a bootable USB of the latest Arch Linux
Installer. If not, please follow the
[Arch wiki guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_media) to create one
for you.

Once you login in the installer disk, You will be logged in on the first virtual console as the
root user, and presented with a _zsh_ shell prompt. I will assume you have an Ethernet connection
and hence will be connected to Internet by default. If you have to rely on wifi, please refer to
the
[Wireless Network Configuration](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wireless_network_configuration)
wiki page for the detailed setup. **You must have Internet connection at this stage before
proceeding any further.**

You should boot into _UEFI_ mode if you have a UEFI motherboard and UEFI mode enabled.

To verify you have booted in UEFI mode, run:

```bash:showLines=false
efivar -l
```

This should give you a list of set UEFI variables. Please look at the
[Arch Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide) in case you do
not get any list of UEFI variables.

The very first thing that annoys me in the virtual console is how tiny all the fonts are. We will
fix that by running the following commands:

```bash:showLines=false
pacman -Sy
pacman -S terminus-font
setfont ter-132n
```

We are all set to get started with the actual installation process.

### HDDs Partitioning

First find the hard drive that you will be using as the main/root disk.

```bash:showLines=false
$ cat /proc/partitions

# OUTPUT eg.
# major minor  #blocks  name

# 8        0  268435456 sda
# 9        0  268435456 sdb
# 19       0  268435456 sdc
# 11       0     759808 sr0
# 7        0     328616 loop0
```

Say, we will be using _/dev/sda_ as the main disk and _/dev/sdb_ as _/data_ and _/dev/sdc_ as
_/media_ .

Because we are creating an encrypted file system it’s a good idea to overwrite it with random data.

We’ll use **badblocks** for this. Another method is to use _dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/xxx_, the
_dd_ method is probably the best method, but is a lot slower. **The following step should take
about 20 minutes on a 240 GB SSD.**

```bash:showLines=false
badblocks -c 10240 -s -w -t random -v /dev/sda
```

Next, we will create GPT partitions on all disks using _gdisk_ command.

```bash:showLines=false
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1M count=5000
$ gdisk /dev/sda
Found invalid MBR and corrupt GPT. What do you want to do? (Using the
GPT MAY permit recovery of GPT data.)
 1 - Use current GPT
 2 - Create blank GPT
```

Then press 2 to create a blank GPT and start fresh

```bash:showLines=false
ZAP:
$ press x - to go to extended menu
$ press z - to zap
$ press Y - to confirm
$ press Y - to delete MBR
```

It might now kick us out of _gdisk_, so get back into it:

```bash:showLines=false
$ gdisk /dev/sda

Command (? for help): m
Command (? for help): n

Partition number (1-128, default 1):
First sector (34-500118158, default = 2048) or {+-}size{KMGTP}:
Last sector (2048-500118, default = 500118) or {+-}size{KMGTP}: 512M
Current type is 'Linux filesystem'
Hex code or GUID (L to show codes, Enter = 8300): ef00
Changed type of partition to 'EFI System'

Partition number (2-128, default 2):
First sector (34-500118, default = 16779264) or {+-}size{KMGTP}:
Last sector (16779264-500118, default = 500118) or {+-}size{KMGTP}:
Current type is 'Linux filesystem'
Hex code or GUID (L to show codes, Enter = 8300):
Changed type of partition to 'Linux filesystem'

Command (? for help): p
Press w to write to disk
Press Y to confirm
```

Repeat the above procedure for _/dev/sdb_ and _/dev/sdc_, but create just one partition with all
values as default. At the end we will have three partitions: _/dev/sda1_, _/dev/sda2_, _/dev/sdb1_
and _/dev/sdc1_.

### Setup Disk Encryption

Our /boot partition will be on _/dev/sda1_, while the main installation will be on _/dev/sda2_. In
this setup, we will be enabling full encryption on _/dev/sda2_ only.

In order to enable disk encryption, we will first create a root luks volume, open it and then
format it.

```bash:showLines=false
# first, we need to prepare the encrypted (outer) volume
$ cryptsetup --cipher aes-xts-plain64 --hash sha512 --use-random --verify-passphrase luksFormat /dev/sda2

# I really hope I don't have to lecture you on NOT LOSING this
# password, lest all of your data will be forever inaccessible,
# right?

# then, we actually open it as a block device, and format the
# inner volume later
$ cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda2 root
```

## Automatic Key Login from an USB/SD Card

If you want to automatically login the encrypted disk password from an externally attached USB or
SD card, you will first need to create a key file.

```bash:showLines=false
dd bs=512 count=4 if=/dev/urandom of=KEYFILE
```

Then, add this key to the luks container, so that it can be later used to open the encrypted drive.

```bash:showLines=false
cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sda2 KEYFILE
```

> Note that the KEYFILE here should be kept on a separate USB drive or SD card.

The recommended way of using such a disk would be as follows:

```bash:showLines=false
# assuming our USB of interest is /dev/sdd  and can be format
#
# Format the drive
$ dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdd bs=1M
# Create partitions using gdisk
#
$ gdisk /dev/sdd
#
# Follow along to create one partition (/dev/sdd1) of type 0700
#
# format /dev/sdd1
$ mkfs.fat /dev/sdd1

# mount the newly format disk on /mnt and then copy the KEYFILE
$ mount /dev/sdd1 /mnt
$ mv KEYFILE /mnt/KEYFILE
$ umount /mnt
```

We will be later using this KEYFILE in boot loader setup.

### Format HDDs

At this point, we have following drives ready for format: _/dev/sda1_, _/dev/mapper/root_,
_/dev/sdb1_ and _/dev/sdc1_.

These can be format as follows:

```bash:showLines=false
mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/sda1
mkfs.btrfs -L arch /dev/mapper/root
mkfs.btrfs -L data /dev/sdb1
mkfs.btrfs -L media /dev/sdc1
```

Now, we will create _btrfs_ subvolumes and mount them properly for installation and final setup.

```bash:showLines=false
mount /dev/mapper/root /mnt
btrfs subvolume create /mnt/ROOT
btrfs subvolume create /mnt/home
umount /mnt

mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
btrfs subvolume create /mnt/data
umount /mnt

mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt
btrfs subvolume create /mnt/media
umount /mnt
```

Now, once the sub-volumes have been created, we will mount them in appropriate locations with
optimal flags.

```bash:showLines=false
SSD_MOUNTS="rw,noatime,nodev,compress=lzo,ssd,discard,space_cache,autodefrag,inode_cache"
HDD_MOUNTS="rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,space_cache"
EFI_MOUNTS="rw,noatime,discard,nodev,nosuid,noexec"
mount -o $SSD_MOUNTS,subvol=ROOT /dev/mapper/root /mnt
mkdir -p /mnt/home
mkdir -p /mnt/data
mkdir -p /mnt/media
mount -o $SSD_MOUNTS,nosuid,subvol=home /dev/mapper/root /mnt/home
mount -o $HDD_MOUNTS,subvol=data /dev/sdb1 /mnt/data
mount -o $HDD_MOUNTS,subvol=media /dev/sdc1 /mnt/media

mkdir -p /mnt/boot
mount -o $EFI_MOUNTS /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
```

> Save the current <i>/etc/resolv.conf</i> file for future use!

```bash:showLines=false
cp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/etc/resolv.conf
```

### Base System Installation

Now, we will do the actually installation of base packages.

```bash:showLines=false
pacstrap /mnt base base-devel btrfs-progs
genfstab -U -p /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```

### Initial System Setup

Edit the _/mnt/ect/fstab_ file to add following _/tmp_ mounts.

```bash:title=/mnt/ect/fstab|showLines=false
tmpfs /tmp tmpfs rw,nodev,nosuid 0 0
tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs rw,nodev,nosuid,noexec 0 0
```

Finally bind root for installation.

```bash:showLines=false
arch-chroot /mnt "bash"
pacman -Syy
pacman -Syu
pacman -S sudo vim
$ vim /etc/locale.gen

...
# en_SG ISO-8859-1
en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
# en_US ISO-8859-1
...

locale-gen
echo LANG=en_US.UTF-8 > /etc/locale.conf
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
ls -l /usr/share/zoneinfo
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Zone/SubZone /etc/localtime
hwclock --systohc --utc
sed -i "s/# %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL/%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL/" /etc/sudoers
HOSTNAME=euler
echo $HOSTNAME > /etc/hostname
passwd
```

We will also add _hostname_ to our `/etc/hosts` file:

```bash
127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain   localhost
::1             localhost.localdomain   localhost
127.0.0.1       $HOSTNAME.localdomain   $HOSTNAME
```

We also need to fix the `mkinitcpio.conf` to contain what we actually need.

```bash:showLines=false
$ vi /etc/mkinitcpio.conf
# on the MODULES section, add "vfat aes_x86_64 crc32c-intel"
# (and whatever else you know your hardware needs. Mine needs i915 too)
# on the BINARIES section, add "/usr/bin/btrfsck", since it's useful
# to have in case your filesystem has troubles
# on the HOOKS section:
#  - add "encrypt" before "filesystems"
#  - remove "fsck" and
#  - add "btrfs" at the end
#
# re-generate your initrd images
mkinitcpio -p linux
```

### Boot Manager Setup

_systemd-boot_, previously called _gummiboot_, is a simple UEFI boot manager which executes
configured EFI images. The default entry is selected by a configured pattern (glob) or an on-screen
menu. It is included with the _systemd_, which is installed on an Arch systems by default.

Assuming _/boot_ is your boot drive, first run the following command to get started:

```bash:showLines=false
bootctl --path=/boot install
```

It will copy the systemd-boot binary to your EFI System Partition (
`/boot/EFI/systemd/systemd-bootx64.efi` and `/boot/EFI/Boot/BOOTX64.EFI` - both of which are
identical - on **x64** systems ) and add _systemd-boot_ itself as the default EFI application
(default boot entry) loaded by the EFI Boot Manager.

Finally to configure out boot loader, we will need the UUID of some of our hard drives. These can
be easily done using the _blkid_ command.

```bash:showLines=false
$ blkid /dev/sda1 > /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf
$ blkid /dev/sda2 >> /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf
$ blkid /dev/mapper/root >> /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf
$ blkid /dev/sdd1 >> /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf

# for this example, I'm going to mark them like this:
# /dev/sda1 LABEL="EFI"                 UUID=11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
# /dev/sda2 LABEL="arch"      UUID=33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333
# /dev/mapper/root LABEL="Arch Linux"   UUID=44444444-4444-4444-4444-444444444444
# /dev/sdd1 LABEL="USB"     UUID=0000-0000  # this is the drive where KEYFILE exists
```

Now, make sure that the following two files look as follows, where UUIDs is the value obtained from
above commands.

> Do not forget to modify UUIDs and KEYFIL entries!

```bash:showLines=false
timeout 3
default arch
```

```bash:showLines=false
title Arch Linux
linux /vmlinuz-linux
initrd /initramfs-linux.img
options ro cryptdevice=UUID=33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333:luks-33333333-3333-3333-3333-333333333333 root=UUID=44444444-4444-4444-4444-444444444444 rootfstype=btrfs rootflags=subvol=ROOT cryptkey=UUID=0000-0000:vfat:KEYFILE
```

### Network Setup

At first we will need to figure out the Ethernet controller on which cable is connected.

```bash:showLines=false
$ networkctl
#
# IDX LINK             TYPE               OPERATIONAL SETUP
#   1 lo               loopback           carrier     unmanaged
#   2 enp3s0           ether              no-carrier  unmanaged
#   3 wlp6s0           wlan               no-carrier  unmanaged
#   4 enp0s25          ether              routable    configured
#
```

In my case, the name of the device is _enp0s25_.

Using this name of the device, we need to configure, and enable the _systemd-networkd.service_
service.

Note that we will using the _resolv.conf_ that we saved from this session.

Network configurations are stored as \*.network in `/etc/systemd/network`. We need to create ours
as follows.:

```bash
[Match]
Name=enp0s25

[Network]
DHCP=ipv4
```

Now enable the `networkd` services:

```bash:showLines=false
systemctl enable systemd-networkd.service
```

Your network should be ready for the first use!

Sync time automatically using the _systemd_ service:

```bash
[Time]
NTP=0.arch.pool.ntp.org 1.arch.pool.ntp.org 2.arch.pool.ntp.org 3.arch.pool.ntp.org
FallbackNTP=0.pool.ntp.org 1.pool.ntp.org 0.fr.pool.ntp.org
```

Now run the following:

```bash:showLines=false
$ timedatectl set-ntp true

$ timedatectl status
...
      Local time: Tue 2016-09-20 16:40:44 PDT
  Universal time: Tue 2016-09-20 23:40:44 UTC
        RTC time: Tue 2016-09-20 23:40:44
       Time zone: US/Pacific (PDT, -0700)
 Network time on: yes
NTP synchronized: yes
 RTC in local TZ: no
 ...

```

[Avahi](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/avahi) is a tool that allows programs to publish and
discover services and hosts running on a local network with no specific configuration. For example
you can plug into a network and instantly find printers to print to, files to look at and people to
talk to.

We can easily set it up it as follows:

```bash:showLines=false
pacman -S avahi nss-mdns
systemctl enable avahi-daemon.service
```

We will also install `terminus-font` on our system to work with proper fonts on first boot.

```bash:showLines=false
pacman -S terminus-font
```

## First Boot Installations

Now we are ready for the first boot! Run the following command:

```bash:showLines=false
exit
umount -R /mnt
reboot
```

After your new system boots, Network should be setup at the start. Check the status of network
using:

```bash:showLines=false
# Set readable font first!
setfont ter-132n
ping google.com -c 2

#
# PING google.com (10.38.24.84) 56(84) bytes of data.
# 64 bytes from google.com (10.38.24.84): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.022 ms
# 64 bytes from google.com (10.38.24.84): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.023 ms
#
# --- google.com ping statistics ---
# 2 packets transmitted, 2 received, 0% packet loss, time 999ms
# rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.022/0.022/0.023/0.004 ms
#
```

If you do not get this output, please follow the troubleshooting links at Arch Wiki on
[setting up network](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd-networkd).

### Adding New User

Choose `$USERNAME` per your liking. I chose _ssingh_, so in future commands whenever you see
_ssingh_ please replace it with your `$USERNAME`.

```bash:showLines=false
pacman -S zsh
useradd -m -G wheel -s usr/bin/zsh $USERNAME
chfn --full-name "$FULL_NAME" $USERNAME
passwd $USERNAME
```

### GUI Installation with nvidia

I will be assuming you have an `NVIDIA` card for graphics installation.

To setup a graphical desktop, first we need to install some basic X related packages, and some
_essential_ packages (including fonts):

```bash:showLines=false
pacman -S xorg-server nvidia nvidia-libgl nvidia-settings mesa
```

To avoid the possibility of forgetting to update your _initramfs_ after an _nvidia_ upgrade, you
have to use a _pacman_ hook like this:

```bash:showLines=false
[Trigger]
Operation=Install
Operation=Upgrade
Operation=Remove
Type=Package
Target=nvidia

[Action]
Depends=mkinitcpio
When=PostTransaction
Exec=/usr/bin/mkinitcpio -p linux
```

Nvidia has a daemon that is to be run at boot. To start the _persistence_ daemon at boot, enable
the `nvidia-persistenced.service`.

```bash:showLines=false
systemctl enable nvidia-persistenced.service
systemctl start nvidia-persistenced.service
```

#### How to Avoid Screen Tearing

Tearing can be avoided by forcing a full composition pipeline, regardless of the compositor you are
using.

In order to make this change permanent, We will need to edit nvidia configuration file. Since, by
default there aren't any, we will first need to create one.

```bash:showLines=false
$ nvidia-xconfig
$ mv /etc/X11/xorg.cong /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf
#
# Edit this file as follows:
vim /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf
# -------------------------------------------
# Section "Screen"
#     Identifier     "Screen0"
#     Option         "metamodes" "nvidia-auto-select +0+0 { ForceFullCompositionPipeline = On }"
#     Option         "AllowIndirectGLXProtocol" "off"
#     Option         "TripleBuffer" "on"
# EndSection
[...]
# Section "Device"
#     [...]
#     Option         "TripleBuffer" "True"
#     [...]
# EndSection
# [...]
# ------------------------------------------------
```

Specific for Plasma 5, we will also create the following file to avoid any tearing in Plasma.

```bash
...
export KWIN_TRIPLE_BUFFER=1
...
```

#### How to Enable Better Resolution During Boot

The kernel compiled in _efifb_ module supports high-resolution nvidia console on EFI systems. This
can enabled by enabling the DRM kernel mode setting.

First, we will need to add following to MODULES section of the _mkinitcpio.conf_ file:

- _nvidia_
- _nvidia_modeset_
- _nvidia_uvm_
- _nvidia_drm_

We will also need to pass the _nvidia-drm.modeset=1_ kernel parameter during the boot.

```bash
...
MODULES="vfat aes_x86_64 crc32c-intel nvidia nvidia_modeset nvidia_uvm nvidia_drm"
...
```

```bash
...
options ro cryptdevice=UUID=:luks- root=UUID= rootfstype=btrfs rootflags=subvol=ROOT cryptkey=UUID=:vfat:deepmind20170602 nvidia-drm.modeset=1
...
```

Finally run:

```bash:showLines=false
$ mkinitcpio -p linux
```

### Plasma 5 Installation and Setup

We can now proceed with the installation of Plasma 5. In the process, we will also install some
useful fonts.

```bash:showLines=false
pacman -S ttf-hack ttf-anonymous-pro
pacman -S ttf-dejavu ttf-freefont ttf-liberation
pacman -S plasma-meta dolphin kdialog kfind
pacman -S konsole gwenview okular spectacle kio-extras
pacman -S kompare dolphin-plugins kwallet kwalletmanager
pacman -S ark yakuake flite
```

We will also need to select proper themes for the Plasma 5 display manager _sddm_ and then enable
its _systemd_ service.

```bash:showLines=true

....
[Theme]
# Current theme name
Current=breeze

# Cursor theme used in the greeter
CursorTheme=breeze_cursors
...
```

Now run:

```bash:showLines=false
$ systemctl enable sddm
$ reboot
```

Once, we boot into the new system, we should have a basic Plasma 5 desktop waiting for you. In the
following section, we will be do installation and modifications to the system that I prefer.

## Post Installation Setup

Plasma 5 provides a handy network manager applet. However, in order to use it properly we will need
the NetworkManager service to be enabled. This applet allows user specific enabling of _wifi_,
_ethernet_ or even _VPN_ connections.

```bash:showLines=false
sudo pacman -S networkmanager
systemctl enable NetworkManager.service
systemctl start NetworkManager.service
```

We can also automate the _hostname_ setup using the following _systemd_ command:

```bash:showLines=false
hostnamectl set-hostname $HOSTNAME
```

### Selecting pacman Mirrors

The _pacman_ package provides a "bash" script, _/usr/bin/rankmirrors_, which can be used to rank
the mirrors according to their connection and opening speeds to take advantage of using the fastest
local mirror.

We will do this only on the US based mirrors. First make a copy of the mirrors list file and then
delete all non-US mirrors. We will then _rankmirrors_ script on the modified list to get the top 6
mirrors for our regular use.

```bash:showLines=false
$ cp /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.backup
$ cp /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.us
$ vim /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.us
....
# Delete all non-US servers
....
$ rankmirrors -n 6 /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.us > /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```

### Setup AUR

[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/) is a community-driven repository for Arch users. This allows you
to install many popular packages that are otherwise not available through core repositories.

In order to make all types of installations uniform, I use
[pacaur](https://github.com/rmarquis/pacaur) as the preferred tool for installing all packages. One
the biggest advantages of _pacaur_ is that is uses exactly the same options that regular _pacman_
uses.

In order to install _pacuar_, first install dependencies.

```bash:showLines=false
sudo pacman -S expac yajl curl gnupg --noconfirm
```

Create a temp directory for building packages:

```bash:showLines=false
mkdir ~/temp
cp ~ temp
```

Install _cower_ first and then _pacaur_:

```bash:showLines=false
gpg --recv-keys --keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu 1EB2638FF56C0C53
curl -o PKGBUILD https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/plain/PKGBUILD?h=cower
makepkg -i PKGBUILD --noconfirm

curl -o PKGBUILD https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/plain/PKGBUILD?h=pacaur
makepkg -i PKGBUILD --noconfirm

# Finally cleanup and remove the temp directory
cd ~
rm -r ~/temp
```

### Audio Setup

This is pretty simple. Install following packages and you should be done:

```bash:showLines=false
sudo pacaur -S alsa-utils pulseaudio pulseaudio-alsa mpv
sudo pacaur -S libcanberra-pulse libcanberra-gstreamer
sudo pacaur -S vlc-qt5
```

Now start the _pulseaudio_ service.

```bash:showLines=false
systemctl --user enable pulseaudio.socket
```

### Web Browsers

My preferred choice of browsers is _google chrome_. However, it is also good to have the KDE native
_qupzilla_.

```bash:showLines=false
sudo pacaur -S google-chrome qupzilla
```

_Profile-sync-daemon (psd)_ is a tiny pseudo-daemon designed to manage browser profile(s) in
_tmpfs_ and to periodically sync back to the physical disc (HDD/SSD). This is accomplished by an
innovative use of _rsync_ to maintain synchronization between a _tmpfs_ copy and media-bound backup
of the browser profile(s). These features of _psd_ leads to following benefits:

- Transparent user experience
- Reduced wear to physical drives, and
- Speed

To setup. first install the _profile-sync-daemon_ package.

```bash:showLines=false
sudo pacaur -S profile-sync-daemon
```

Run _psd_ the first time which will create a configuration file at \$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/psd/psd.conf
which contains all settings.

```bash:showLines=false
$ psd
# First time running psd so please edit
# /home/$USERNAME/.config/psd/psd.conf to your liking and run again.
```

In the config file change the BROWSERS variables to _google-chrome qupzilla_. Also, enable the use
of _overlayfs_ to improve sync speed and to use a smaller memory footprint. Do this in the
_USE_OVERLAYFS="yes"_ variable.

> Note: USE_OVERLAYFS feature requires a Linux kernel version of 3.18.0 or greater to work.

In order to use the OVERLAYFS feature, you will also need to give _sudo_ permissions to psd-helper
as follows (replace `$USERNAME` accordingly):

```bash
...
$USERNAME ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/psd-overlay-helper
...
```

Verify the working of configuration using the preview mode of psd:

```bash:showLines=false
psd p
```

_Google Chrome_ by default uses _kdewallet_ to manage passwords, where as _Qupzilla_ does not. You
can change that in its settings.

### git Setup

Install git and setup some global options as below:

```bash:showLines=false
$ sudo pacaur -S git
```

and setup gitconfig as:

```bash:title=~/.gitconfig|showLines=false
[user]
    name = Sadanand Singh
    email = EMAIL_ADDRESS
[color]
    ui = auto
[status]
    showuntrackedfiles = no
[alias]
    gist = log --graph --oneline --all --decorate --date-order
    find = log --graph --oneline --all --decorate --date-order --regexp-ignore-case --extended-regexp --grep
    rfind = log --graph --oneline --all --decorate --date-order --regexp-ignore-case --extended-regexp --invert-grep --grep
    search = grep --line-number --ignore-case -E -I
[pager]
    status = true
[push]
    default = matching
[merge]
    tool = meld
[diff]
    tool = meld

[help]
    autocorrect = 1
```

### ssh Setup

To get started first install the _openssh_ package.

```bash:showLines=false
sudo pacaur -S openssh
```

The ssh server can be started using the _systemd_ service. Before starting the service, however, we
want to generate ssh keys and setup the server for login based only on keys.

```bash:showLines=false
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

Now create ssh config as:

```bash:showLines=false
# Create a .ssh/config file for rmate usage in sublime text
...
RemoteForward 52698 localhost:52698
...
```

```bash:showLines=false
# Create ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file with list of machines that
# are allowed to login to this machine.
$ touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Finally edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# file to disable Password based logins
$ sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
...
PasswordAuthentication no
...
```

Furthermore, before enabling the _sshd_ service, please also ensure to copy your keys to all your
relevant other servers and places like github.

We can now use _systemd_ to start the ssh service.

```bash:showLines=false
systemctl enable sshd.socket
systemctl start sshd.socket
```

### zsh Setup

During the user creation, we already installed the _zsh_ shell. We have also activated a basic
setup at first login by the user.

In this section, we will be installing my variation of
[zprezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) package to manage _zsh_ configurations.

First install the main zprezto package:

```bash:showLines=false
git clone --recursive https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto.git "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.zprezto"

setopt EXTENDED_GLOB
for rcfile in "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}"/.zprezto/runcoms/^README.md(.N);
do
    ln -sf "$rcfile" "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/.${rcfile:t}"
done

```

Now, We will add my version of prezto to the same git repo.

```bash:showLines=false
cd ~/.zprezto
git remote add personal git@github.com:sadanand-singh/My-Zprezto.git
git pull personal arch
git checkout arch
git merge master
```

And we are all setup for using _zsh_!

### gpg Setup

We have already installed the _gnupg_ package during the _pacaur_ installation. We will first
either import our already existing private keys(s) or create one.

Once We have our keys setup, edit keys to change trust level.

Once all keys are setup, we need to gpg-agent configuration file:

```bash
..
enable-ssh-support
default-cache-ttl-ssh 10800
default-cache-ttl 10800
max-cache-ttl-ssh 10800
...

```

Also, add following to your _.zshrc_ or _."bash"rc_ file. If you are using my zprezto setup, you
already have this!

```bash:showLines=false
$ vim ~/.zshrc
...
# set GPG TTY
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)

# Refresh gpg-agent tty in case user switches into an X Session
gpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye >/dev/null

# Set SSH to use gpg-agent
unset SSH_AGENT_PID
if [ "${gnupg_SSH_AUTH_SOCK_by:-0}" -ne $$ ]; then
  export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="/run/user/$UID/gnupg/S.gpg-agent.ssh"
fi
...

```

Now, simply start the following systemd sockets as user:

```bash:showLines=false
systemctl --user enable gpg-agent.socket
systemctl --user enable gpg-agent-ssh.socket
systemctl --user enable dirmngr.socket
systemctl --user enable gpg-agent-browser.socket

systemctl --user start gpg-agent.socket
systemctl --user start gpg-agent-ssh.socket
systemctl --user start dirmngr.socket
systemctl --user start gpg-agent-browser.socket
```

Finally add your ssh key to ssh agent.

```bash:showLines=false
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

### User Wallpapers

You can store your own wallpapers at the following location. A good place to get some good
wallpapers are [KaOS Wallpapers](https://github.com/KaOSx/kaos-wallpapers).

```bash:showLines=false
mkdir -p $ $HOME/.local/wallpapers
cp SOME_JPEG $HOME/.local/wallpapers/
```

### _conky_ Setup

First installed the _conky_ package with lua and nvidia support:

```bash:showLines=false
paci conky-lua-nv
```

Then, copy your conky configuration at \$HOME/.config/conky/conky.conf.

```bash:showLines=false
mkdir -p $HOME/.config/conky

# Generate sample conky config file
conky -C > $HOME/.config/conky/conky.conf

# start conky in background
conky &
```

Here, I have also put my simple configuration file:

```lua
conky.config = {
        background = true,
        use_xft = true,
        xftalpha = 0.2,

```

### Software Installations

Here is a running list of other common softwares that I install.

```bash:showLines=false
paci spotify tmux tree dropbox thesilver_searcher
paci digikam imagemagick
```

I also add the following repository to install the [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
editor. Refer to my previous post on [sublimetext](https://www.sublimetext.com/) for details on
setting up Sublime Text.

```bash:showLines=false
curl -O https://download.sublimetext.com/sublimehq-pub.gpg
sudo pacman-key --add sublimehq-pub.gpg
sudo pacman-key --lsign-key 8A8F901A
rm sublimehq-pub.gpg

echo -e "\n[sublime-text]\nServer = https://download.sublimetext.com/arch/dev/x86_64" | sudo tee -a /etc/pacman.conf
```

Now we can install _sublime-text_ as:

```bash:showLines=false
paci sublime-text/sublime-text
```
