I have started eating a lot of greens these days. As a kid, I always loved a vegetable made by my
mom, which was made of red leaves, called "_Laal Saag_" in Hindi. I could never find what exactly
was the English/American name for those leaves.

Recently, at one of the Korean grocery stores, I came across red Amaranth leaves. Those looked
strikingly similar to the red leaves that I used to have back home in India.

So, here is my super fast and healthy recipe for these red leaves. It took me just 10 minutes ( 5
Minutes Preparation + 5 Minutes Cooking).

## Ingredients

- 1 Bunch Red Amaranth Leaves
- 1/2 tbsp Turmeric Powder
- 1 tbsp Coriander Powder
- 1 tbsp _Garam Masala_
- 1 tbsp Mustard Black Seeds
- 1 tbsp Cumin Seeds
- 2 tbsp Olive Oil
- Salt to taste

## Preparation

- Wash the leaves thoroughly in running water and chop them (about 1 inch cuts).
- Heat a deep pan on Medium for about 1 minute and then pour olive oil into it.
- After about 30 seconds, Add mustard seeds and cumin seeds after another 30 seconds.
- Once Seeds start to pop, add cut leaves into the pan.
- Add salt, close the lid and keep stirring occasionally.
- Once the leaves have lost water, add all the spices and keep frying until things are dry (about
  2-3 minutes).

You can serve this with any Indian bread, or with rice and lentils (_Daal_).
