This is for all the lazy souls like me - in a mood to eat something tasty, but in no mood to cook
for long.

Vermicelli, or also known as _seviyan_ in Hindi, is commonly cooked as a sweet dish in Indian
subcontinent. As I try to be away from all things sweet, I came across this recipe which uses this
in a quite spicy flavor.

So, here is my super quick and tasty recipe for these noodles. It takes less than 12 minutes ( 4
Minutes Preparation + 8 Minutes Cooking).

## Ingredients

- 300 g Vermicelli _Seviyan_
- 1 cup Peas
- 1/2 Medium Onion
- 1 Medium Tomato
- 1 Clove of Garlic
- 4 Curry Leaves
- 1/2 tbsp Turmeric Powder
- 1 tbsp Coriander Powder
- 1 tbsp Mustard Black Seeds
- 1 tbsp Cumin Seeds
- 2 tbsp Olive Oil
- Salt to taste
- 1/2 cup Peanuts _optional_

## Preparation

- Wash the leaves thoroughly in running water and chop them (about 1 inch cuts).
- Heat a deep pan on Medium for about 1 minute and then pour olive oil into it.
- After about 30 seconds, Add mustard seeds and cumin seeds after another 30 seconds.
- Once Seeds start to pop, add garlic and cut onions.
- Fry the onions until oil starts to separate (about 1-2 minutes)
- Add spices, curry leaves, peas and tomatoes.
- After about a minute, add noodles.
- After another minute or so, add salt, and keep stirring occasionally.
- Once the noodles have become light golden brown in color, add 1/2 cup of water (about 2-3
  minutes).
- Keep stirring, so that noodles do not stick with each other, for about another 2 minutes

Let it cool before serving. You can use some ketchup or sauce with it. I like adding peanuts to it
while frying onions.
