Typically, hunger and laziness come to me as inseparable couples. To make things worse, I have been
trying to eat healthy.

Nevertheless, here is another recipe that solves all these at once. Its my _five minute_ Tilapia
Fish Recipe.

Two major ingredients - fish and veggies, of this recipe can be grabbed from the frozen section of
any supermarket.
