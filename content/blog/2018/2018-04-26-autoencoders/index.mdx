Usually in a conventional neural network, one tries to predict a target vector `y` from input
vectors `x`. In an auto-encoder network, one tries to predict `x` from `x`. It is trivial to learn
a mapping from `x` to `x` if the network has no constraints, but if the network is constrained the
learning process becomes more interesting.

In this article, we are going to take a detailed look at
the mathematics of different types of autoencoders (with different constraints) along with a sample
implementation of it using [Keras][keras], with a [tensorflow] back-end.

## Basic Autoencoders

The simplest AutoEncoder (AE) has an MLP-like (Multi Layer Perceptron) structure:

- Input Layer
- Hidden Layer, and
- Output Layer

However, unlike MLP, autoencoders do not require any target data. As the network is trying to learn
$x$ itself, the learning algorithm is a special case of
[unsupervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning).

    <figcaption class="text-center">A Typical Autoencoder Network</figcaption>
 </figure>

Mathematically, lets define:

- Input vector: $x \in \Big[ 0, 1 \Big]^d$
- Activation function: $a(h)$ applied to very nuron of layer $h$
- $W_i \in \mathbb{R}^{I_{di} \times O_{di}}$, the parameter matrix of $i$-th layer, projecting a
  $I_{di}$ dimensional input in a $O_{di}$dimensional space
- $b_i \in \mathbb{R}^{O_{di}}$ bias vector

The simplest AE can then be summarized as:

$$
\begin{aligned} z &=  a(x W_1 + b_1) \cr
               x' &=  a(z W_2 + b_2) \end{aligned}
$$

The AE model tries to minimize the **reconstruction error** between the input value $x$ and the
reconstructed value $x'$. A typical definition of the reconstruction error is the $L_p$ distance
(like $L_2$ norm) between the $x$ and $x'$ vectors:

$$
\min \mathcal{L} = \min E(x, x') \stackrel{e.g.}{=} \min || x - x' ||_p
$$

Another common variant of loss function (especially images) for AE is the cross entropy function.

$$
\mathcal{L}(x, x') = -\sum_{c=1}^{M} x'_c \log (x_c)
$$

where $M$ is the dimensionality of the input data $x$ (for eg. no. of pixels in an image).

## Autoencoders in Practice

The above example of auto-encoder is too simplistic for any real use case. It can be easily noticed
that if the number of units in the hidden layer is greater than or equal to the number of input
units, the network will learn the identity function easily. Hence, the simplest constraint used in
real-life autoencoders is the **number of hidden units** ($z$) should be less than the dimensions
($d$) of the input ($z < d$).

By limiting the amount of information that can flow through the network, AE model can learn the
most important attributes of the input data and how to best reconstruct the original input from an
"encoded" state. Ideally, this encoding will **learn and describe latent attributes of the input
data.** Dimensionality reduction using AEs leads to better results than classical dimensionality
reduction techniques such as [PCA][pca] due to the non-linearity and the type of constraints
applied.

<Callout type="note">

**PCA and Autoencoders**

If we were to construct a linear network (i.e. without the use
of nonlinear activation functions at each layer) we would observe a similar dimensionality
reduction as observed in [PCA][pca]. See [Geoffrey Hinton's discussion][1].

A practical auto-encoder network consists of an encoding function (_encoder_), and a decoding
function (_decoder_). Following is an example architecture for the reconstruction of images.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/sadanandsingh/image/upload/v1567364020/autoencoders/img2.png)

In this article we will build different types of autoencoders for the [fashion MNIST][f-mnist]
dataset. In stead of using more common [MNIST][mnist] dataset, I prefer to use [fashion
MNIST][f-mnist] dataset for the [reasons described here][2].

[f-mnist]: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist
[mnist]: https://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
[2]: https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist#to-serious-machine-learning-researchers

For example using [MNIST][mnist] data, please have a look at the [article] by [Francois
Chollet][3], the creator of [Keras]. The code below is heavily adapted from his article.

[article]: https://blog.keras.io/building-autoencoders-in-keras.html
[3]: https://twitter.com/fchollet

We'll start simple, with a single fully-connected neural layer as encoder and as decoder.

```python
from keras.layers import Input, Dense
from keras.models import Model
import numpy as np

# size of bottleneck latent space
encoding_dim = 32
# input placeholder
input_img = Input(shape=(784,))
# encoded representation
encoded = Dense(encoding_dim, activation='relu')(input_img)
# lossy reconstruction
decoded = Dense(784, activation='sigmoid')(encoded)

# full AE model: map an input to its reconstruction
autoencoder = Model(input_img, decoded)

```

We will also create separate encoding and decoding functions, that can be used to extract latent
features at test time.

```python:showLines=false
# encoder: map an input to its encoded representation
encoder = Model(input_img, encoded)
# placeholder for an encoded input
encoded_input = Input(shape=(encoding_dim,))
# last layer of the autoencoder model
decoder_layer = autoencoder.layers[-1]
# decoder
decoder = Model(encoded_input, decoder_layer(encoded_input))

```

We can now set the optimizer and the loss function before training the auto-encoder model.

```python:showLines=false
autoencoder.compile(optimizer='rmsprop', loss='binary_crossentropy')
```

Next, we need to get the [fashion MNIST] data and normalize it for training. Furthermore, we will
flatten the $28\times28$ images to a vector of size 784. Please note that running the code below
for the first time will download the full dataset and hence might take few minutes.

```python
from keras.datasets import fashion_mnist

(x_train, _), (x_test, _) = fashion_mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255.
x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255.
x_train = x_train.reshape((len(x_train), np.prod(x_train.shape[1:])))
x_test = x_test.reshape((len(x_test), np.prod(x_test.shape[1:])))
print(x_train.shape, x_test.shape)

```

**Output:** (60000, 784) (10000, 784)

We can now train our model for 100 epochs:

```python
history = autoencoder.fit(x_train, x_train,
                epochs=100,
                batch_size=256,
                shuffle=True,
                validation_data=(x_test, x_test))
```

This will print per epoch training and validation loss. But we can plot the loss history during
training using the history object.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_train_history_loss(history):
    # summarize history for loss
    plt.plot(history.history['loss'])
    plt.plot(history.history['val_loss'])
    plt.title('model loss')
    plt.ylabel('loss')
    plt.xlabel('epoch')
    plt.legend(['train', 'test'], loc='upper right')
    plt.show()

plot_train_history_loss(history)

```

**Output:**

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/sadanandsingh/image/upload/v1567364020/autoencoders/img3.png)

After 100 epochs, the auto-encoder reaches a stable train/text loss value of about 0.282. Let us
look visually how good of reconstruction this simple model does!

```python
# encode and decode some images from test set
encoded_imgs = encoder.predict(x_test)
decoded_imgs = decoder.predict(encoded_imgs)

def display_reconstructed(x_test, decoded_imgs, n=10):
    plt.figure(figsize=(20, 4))
    for i in range(n):
        # display original
        ax = plt.subplot(2, n, i + 1)
        plt.imshow(x_test[i].reshape(28, 28))
        plt.gray()
        ax.get_xaxis().set_visible(False)
        ax.get_yaxis().set_visible(False)

        if decoded_imgs is not None:
            # display reconstruction
            ax = plt.subplot(2, n, i + 1 + n)
            plt.imshow(decoded_imgs[i].reshape(28, 28))
            plt.gray()
            ax.get_xaxis().set_visible(False)
            ax.get_yaxis().set_visible(False)
    plt.show()

display_reconstructed(x_test, decoded_imgs, 10)

```

The top row is the original image, while bottom row is the reconstructed image. We can see that we
are loosing a lot of fine details.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/sadanandsingh/image/upload/v1567364020/autoencoders/img4.png)

## Sparsity Constraint

We can add an additional constraint to the above AE model, a sparsity constraints on the latent
variables. Mathematically, this is achieved by adding a sparsity penalty $\Omega(\mathbf{h})$ on
the bottleneck layer $\mathbf{h}$.

$$
\min \mathcal{L} = \min E(x, x') + \Omega(h)
$$

where, $\mathbf{h}$ is the encoder output.

Sparsity is a desired characteristic for an auto-encoder, because it allows to use a greater number
of hidden units (even more than the input ones) and therefore gives the network the ability of
learning different connections and extract different features (w.r.t. the features extracted with
the only constraint on the number of hidden units). Moreover, sparsity can be used together with
the constraint on the number of hidden units: an optimization process of the combination of these
hyper-parameters is required to achieve better performance.

In Keras, sparsity constraint can be achieved by adding an **activity_regularizer** to our Dense
layer:

```python
from keras import regularizers

encoding_dim = 32

input_img = Input(shape=(784,))
# add a Dense layer with a L1 activity regularizer
encoded = Dense(encoding_dim, activation='relu',
                activity_regularizer=regularizers.l1(1e-8))(input_img)
decoded = Dense(784, activation='sigmoid')(encoded)

autoencoder = Model(input_img, decoded)
```

Similar to the previous model, we can train this as well for 150 epochs. Using a regularizer is
less likely to overfit and hence can be trained for longer.

```python
autoencoder.compile(optimizer='rmsprop', loss='binary_crossentropy')
history = autoencoder.fit(x_train, x_train,
                epochs=150,
                batch_size=256,
                shuffle=True,
                validation_data=(x_test, x_test))

plot_train_history_loss(history)
```

We get a very similar loss as the previous example. Here is a plot of loss values during training.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/sadanandsingh/image/upload/v1567364020/autoencoders/img5.png)

As expected, the reconstructed images too look quite similar as before.

```python
decoded_imgs = autoencoder.predict(x_test)
display_reconstructed(x_test, decoded_imgs, 10)
```

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/sadanandsingh/image/upload/v1567364020/autoencoders/img6.png)

## Deep Autoencoders

We have been using only single layers for encoders and decoders. Given we have large enough data,
there is nothing that stops us from building deeper networks for encoders and decoders.

```python
input_img = Input(shape=(784,))
encoded = Dense(128, activation='relu')(input_img)
encoded = Dense(64, activation='relu')(encoded)
encoded = Dense(32, activation='relu')(encoded)

decoded = Dense(64, activation='relu')(encoded)
decoded = Dense(128, activation='relu')(decoded)
decoded = Dense(784, activation='sigmoid')(decoded)

autoencoder = Model(input_img, decoded)
```

We can train this model, same as before.

```python
autoencoder.compile(optimizer='rmsprop', loss='binary_crossentropy')
history = autoencoder.fit(x_train, x_train,
                epochs=150,
                batch_size=256,
                shuffle=True,
                validation_data=(x_test, x_test))

plot_train_history_loss(history)
```

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/sadanandsingh/image/upload/v1567364020/autoencoders/img7.png)

The average loss is now 0.277, as compared to ~0.285 before! We can also see that visually all
reconstructed images too look slightly better.

```python
decoded_imgs = autoencoder.predict(x_test)
display_reconstructed(x_test, decoded_imgs, 10)
```

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/sadanandsingh/image/upload/v1567364020/autoencoders/img8.png)

## Convolutional Autoencoders

Since our inputs are images, it makes sense to use convolution neural networks (conv-nets) as
encoders and decoders. In practical settings, autoencoders applied to images are always convolution
autoencoders --they simply perform much better.

The encoder will consist of a stack of `Conv2D` and `MaxPooling2D` layers (max pooling being used
for spatial down-sampling), while the decoder will consist of a stack of `Conv2D` and
`UpSampling2D` layers. We will also be using `BatchNormalization`. One major difference between
this network and prior ones is that now we have 256 (4x4x16) elements in the bottleneck layer as
opposed to just 32 before!

You can read more about convolution-based auto-encoders in further details [here][cae].

[cae]: https://pgaleone.eu/neural-networks/2016/11/24/convolutional-autoencoders/

```python
from keras.layers import Input, Dense, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, UpSampling2D, BatchNormalization
from keras.models import Model
from keras import backend as K

input_img = Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))

x = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', use_bias=False)(input_img)
x = BatchNormalization(axis=-1)(x)
x = MaxPooling2D((2, 2), padding='same')(x)
x = Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', use_bias=False)(x)
x = BatchNormalization(axis=-1)(x)
x = MaxPooling2D((2, 2), padding='same')(x)
x = Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', use_bias=False)(x)
x = BatchNormalization(axis=-1)(x)
encoded = MaxPooling2D((2, 2), padding='same')(x)

x = Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', use_bias=False)(encoded)
x = BatchNormalization(axis=-1)(x)
x = UpSampling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', use_bias=False)(x)
x = BatchNormalization(axis=-1)(x)
x = UpSampling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='valid', use_bias=False)(x)
x = BatchNormalization(axis=-1)(x)
x = UpSampling2D((2, 2))(x)
decoded = Conv2D(1, (3, 3), activation='sigmoid', padding='same', use_bias=False)(x)

autoencoder = Model(input_img, decoded)
autoencoder.compile(optimizer='rmsprop', loss='binary_crossentropy')
```

To train it, we will use the original fashion MNIST digits with shape (samples, 1, 28, 28), and we
will just normalize pixel values between 0 and 1.

```python
(x_train, _), (x_test, _) = fashion_mnist.load_data()

x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255.
x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255.
x_train = np.reshape(x_train, (len(x_train), 28, 28, 1))
x_test = np.reshape(x_test, (len(x_test), 28, 28, 1))
```

Similar to before, we can train this model for 150 epochs. However, unlike before, we will
checkpoint the model during training to save the best model, based on the validation loss minima.

```python
from keras.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint

fpath = "weights-ae-{epoch:02d}-{val_loss:.3f}.hdf5"
callbacks = [ModelCheckpoint(fpath, monitor='val_loss', verbose=1, save_best_only=True, mode='min')]
history = autoencoder.fit(x_train, x_train,
                epochs=150,
                batch_size=256,
                shuffle=True,
                validation_data=(x_test, x_test),
                callbacks=callbacks)

plot_train_history_loss(history)
```

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/sadanandsingh/image/upload/v1567364020/autoencoders/img9.png)

We find the lowest validation loss now is 0.265, significantly lower than the previous best value
of 0.277. We will first load the saved best model weights, and then plot the original and the
reconstructed images from the test dataset.

```python
autoencoder.load_weights('weights-ae-146-0.266.hdf5')
decoded_imgs = autoencoder.predict(x_test)
display_reconstructed(x_test, decoded_imgs, 10)
```

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/sadanandsingh/image/upload/v1567364020/autoencoders/img10.png)

At first glance, it seems not much of improvement over the deep autoencoders result. However, if
you notice closely, we start to see small feature details to appear on the reconstructed images. In
order to improve these models further, we will likely have to go for deeper and more complex
convolution network.

## Denoising Autoencoders

Another common variant of AE networks is the one that learns to remove noise from the input.
Mathematically, this is achieved by modifying the reconstruction error of the loss function.

Traditionally, autoencoders minimize some loss function:

$$
L\Big(x, g\big(f(x)\big)\Big)
$$

where, $L$ is a loss function penalizing reconstructed input $g\big(f(x)\big)$ for being dissimilar
to the input $x$. Also, $g(.)$ is the decoder and $f(.)$ is the encoder. A Denoising autoencoders
(DAE) instead minimizes,

$$
L\Big(x, g\big(f(\hat{x})\big)\Big)
$$

where, $\hat{x}$ is a copy of $x$ that has been corrupted by some form of noise. DAEs must
therefore undo this corruption rather than simply copying their input. Training of DAEs forces
$f(.)$, the encoder and $g(.)$, the decoder to implicitly learn the structure of $p_{data}(x),$ the
distribution of the input data $x$. Please refer to the works of [Alain and Bengio (2013)][ref1]
and [Bengio et al. (2013)][ref2].

[ref1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.4246
[ref2]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6663

For a example, we will first introduce noise to our train and test data by applying a guassian
noise matrix and clipping the images between 0 and 1.

```python
(x_train, _), (x_test, _) = fashion_mnist.load_data()

x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255.
x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255.
x_train = np.reshape(x_train, (len(x_train), 28, 28, 1))
x_test = np.reshape(x_test, (len(x_test), 28, 28, 1))

noise_factor = 0.5
x_train_noisy = x_train + noise_factor * np.random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=x_train.shape)
x_test_noisy = x_test + noise_factor * np.random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=x_test.shape)

x_train_noisy = np.clip(x_train_noisy, 0., 1.)
x_test_noisy = np.clip(x_test_noisy, 0., 1.)
```

Here is how the corrupted images look now. They are barely recognizable now!

```python
display_reconstructed(x_test_noisy, None)
```

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/sadanandsingh/image/upload/v1567364020/autoencoders/img11.png)

We will use a slightly modified version of the previous convolution autoencoder, the one with
larger number of filters in the intermediate layers. This increases the capacity of our model.

```python
input_img = Input(shape=(28, 28, 1))

x = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', use_bias=False)(input_img)
x = BatchNormalization(axis=-1)(x)
x = MaxPooling2D((2, 2), padding='same')(x)
x = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', use_bias=False)(x)
x = BatchNormalization(axis=-1)(x)
x = MaxPooling2D((2, 2), padding='same')(x)
x = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', use_bias=False)(x)
x = BatchNormalization(axis=-1)(x)
encoded = MaxPooling2D((2, 2), padding='same')(x)

x = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', use_bias=False)(encoded)
x = BatchNormalization(axis=-1)(x)
x = UpSampling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', use_bias=False)(x)
x = BatchNormalization(axis=-1)(x)
x = UpSampling2D((2, 2))(x)
x = Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='valid', use_bias=False)(x)
x = BatchNormalization(axis=-1)(x)
x = UpSampling2D((2, 2))(x)
decoded = Conv2D(1, (3, 3), activation='sigmoid', padding='same', use_bias=False)(x)

autoencoder = Model(input_img, decoded)
autoencoder.compile(optimizer='rmsprop', loss='binary_crossentropy')
```

We can now train this for 150 epochs. Notice the change in the training data!

```python
fpath = "weights-dae-{epoch:02d}-{val_loss:.3f}.hdf5"
callbacks = [ModelCheckpoint(fpath, monitor='val_loss', verbose=1, save_best_only=True, mode='min')]
history = autoencoder.fit(x_train_noisy, x_train,
                epochs=150,
                batch_size=256,
                shuffle=True,
                validation_data=(x_test_noisy, x_test),
                callbacks=callbacks)

plot_train_history_loss(history)
```

The loss has converged to a value of 0.287. Let's take a look at the results, top row are noisy
images and the bottom row are the reconstructed images from the DAE.

**Sequence-to-Sequence Autoencoders**

If your inputs are sequences, rather than 2D
images, then you may want to use as encoder and decoder a type of model that can capture temporal
structure, such as a [LSTM][lstm]. To build a LSTM-based auto-encoder, first use a [LSTM][lstm]
encoder to turn your input sequences into a single vector that contains information about the
entire sequence, then repeat this vector $n$ times (where $n$ is the number of time steps in the
output sequence), and run a [LSTM][lstm] decoder to turn this constant sequence into the target
sequence.

## Variational Autoencoders (VAE)

Variational autoencoders (VAE) are stochastic version of the regular autoencoders. It's a type of
autoencoder with added constraints on the encoded representations being learned. More precisely, it
is an autoencoder that learns a [latent variable model][lvm] for its input data. So instead of
letting your neural network learn an arbitrary function, you are learning the parameters of a
probability distribution modeling your data. If you sample points from this distribution, you can
generate new input data samples: a VAE is a "generative model". The cartoon on the side shows a
typical architecture of a VAE model. Please refer to the research papers by [Kingma et
al.][vae_ref1] and [Rezende et al.][vae_ref2] for a thorough mathematical analysis.

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/sadanandsingh/image/upload/v1567364021/autoencoders/img14.png)

In the probability model framework, a variational autoencoder contains a specific probability model
of data $x$ and latent variables $z$ (most commonly assumed as Guassian). We can write the joint
probability of the model as $p(x, z) = p(x \vert z)p(z)$. The generative process can be written as,
for each data point $i$:

- Draw latent variables $z_i \sim p(z)$
- Draw data point $x_i \sim p(x\vert z)$

In terms of an implementation of VAE, the latent variables are generated by the encoder and the
data points are drawn by the decoder. The latent variable hence is a random variable drawn from a
posterior distribution, $p(z)$. To implement the encoder and the decoder as a neural network, you
need to backpropogate through random sampling and that is a problem because backpropogation cannot
flow through a random node. To overcome this, the **reparameterization trick** is used. Most
commonly, the true posterior distribution for the latent space is assumed to be Guassian. Since our
posterior is normally distributed, we can approximate it with another normal distribution,
$\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.

$$
p(z) \sim \mu + L \mathcal{N}(0, 1)
$$

Here $\mu$ and $L$ are the output of the encoder. Therefore while backpropogation, all we need is
partial derivatives w.r.t. $\mu$, $L$. In the cartoon above, $\mu$ represents the mean vector
latent variable and $L$ represents the standard deviation latent variable.

You can read more about VAE models at [_**Reference 1**_][vae1], [_**Reference 2**_][vae2],
[_**Reference 3**_][vae3] and [_**Reference 4**_][vae].

In more practical terms, VAEs represent latent space (bottleneck layer) as a Guassian random
variable (enabled by a constraint on the loss function). Hence, the loss function for the VAEs
consist of two terms: a reconstruction loss forcing the decoded samples to match the initial inputs
(just like in our previous autoencoders), and the KL divergence between the learned latent
distribution and the prior distribution, acting as a regularization term.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \min \mathcal{L}(x, x') &= \min E(x, x') \cr
&+ KL\big(q(z\vert x)\vert \vert p(z)\big)
\end{aligned}
$$

Here, the first term is the reconstruction loss as before (in a typical auto-encoder). The second
term is the [Kullback-Leibler divergence][kl] between the encoder’s distribution, $q(z\vert x)$ and
the true posterior $p(z)$, typically a Guassian.

As typically (especially for images) the binary [cross-entropy][ce] is used as the reconstruction
loss term, the above loss term for the VAEs can be written as,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \min{\mathcal{L}(x, x')} &= - \min{\mathbf{E}_{z\sim q(z\vert x)}}\big[ \log p(x' \vert z)\big] \cr
 &+ KL\big(q(z\vert x) \vert \vert p(z)\big)
\end{aligned}
$$

To summarize a typical implementation of a VAE, first, an encoder network turns the input samples
$x$ into two parameters in a latent space, `z_mean` and `z_log_sigma`. Then, we randomly sample
similar points $z$ from the latent normal distribution that is assumed to generate the data, via
$z$ = `z_mean` + `exp(z_log_sigma)` \* $\mathbf{\epsilon}$, where $\mathbf{\epsilon}$ is a random
normal tensor. Finally, a decoder network maps these latent space points back to the original input
data.

We can now implement VAE for the fashion MNIST data. To demonstrate its generalization, we will
generate two versions: one with MLP and the other with the use of convolution and deconvolution
layers.

In the first implementation below, we will be using a simple 2-layer deep encoder and a 2-layer
deep decoder. Note the use of the reparameterization trick via the `sampling()` method and a
`Lambda` layer.

```python
from scipy.stats import norm

from keras.layers import Input, Dense, Lambda, Flatten, Reshape
from keras.layers import Conv2D, Conv2DTranspose
from keras.models import Model
from keras import backend as K
from keras import metrics

batch_size = 128
original_dim = 784
latent_dim = 2
intermediate_dim = 256
epochs = 100
epsilon_std = 1.0


x = Input(shape=(original_dim,))
h = Dense(intermediate_dim, activation='relu')(x)
z_mean = Dense(latent_dim)(h)
z_log_var = Dense(latent_dim)(h)


def sampling(args):
    z_mean, z_log_var = args
    epsilon = K.random_normal(shape=(K.shape(z_mean)[0], latent_dim), mean=0.,
                              stddev=epsilon_std)
    return z_mean + K.exp(z_log_var / 2) * epsilon

# note that "output_shape" isn't necessary with the TensorFlow backend
z = Lambda(sampling, output_shape=(latent_dim,))([z_mean, z_log_var])

# to reuse these later
decoder_h = Dense(intermediate_dim, activation='relu')
decoder_mean = Dense(original_dim, activation='sigmoid')
h_decoded = decoder_h(z)
x_decoded_mean = decoder_mean(h_decoded)

# instantiate VAE model
vae = Model(x, x_decoded_mean)
```

As described above, we need to include two loss terms, binary cross entropy as before and the KL
divergence between the encoder latent variable distribution (calculated using the
reparameterization trick) and the true posterior distribution, a normal distribution!

```python
# Compute VAE loss
xent_loss = original_dim * metrics.binary_crossentropy(x, x_decoded_mean)
kl_loss = - 0.5 * K.sum(1 + z_log_var - K.square(z_mean) - K.exp(z_log_var), axis=-1)
vae_loss = K.mean(xent_loss + kl_loss)

vae.add_loss(vae_loss)
vae.compile(optimizer='rmsprop')
```

we can now load the fashion MNIST dataset, normalize it and reshape it to correct dimensions so
that it can be used with our VAE model.

```python
# train the VAE on fashion MNIST images
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = fashion_mnist.load_data()

x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255.
x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255.
x_train = x_train.reshape((len(x_train), np.prod(x_train.shape[1:])))
x_test = x_test.reshape((len(x_test), np.prod(x_test.shape[1:])))
```

We will now train our model for 100 epochs.

```python
history = vae.fit(x_train,
        shuffle=True,
        epochs=epochs,
        batch_size=batch_size,
        validation_data=(x_test, None))

plot_train_history_loss(history)
```

Below is the loss for the training and the validation datasets during training epochs. We find that
loss has converged in 100 epochs without any sign of over fitting.

Because our latent space is two-dimensional, there are a few cool visualizations that can be done
at this point. One is to look at the neighborhoods of different classes on the latent 2D plane:

```python
# build a model to project inputs on the latent space
encoder = Model(x, z_mean)

# display a 2D plot of the digit classes in the latent space
def plot_latentSpace(encoder, x_test, y_test, batch_size):
    x_test_encoded = encoder.predict(x_test, batch_size=batch_size)
    plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
    plt.scatter(x_test_encoded[:, 0], x_test_encoded[:, 1], c=y_test, cmap='tab10')
    plt.colorbar()
    plt.show()

plot_latentSpace(encoder, x_test, y_test, batch_size)
```

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/sadanandsingh/image/upload/v1544987535/images/autoencoders/vae_fc_latent.png)

Each of these colored clusters is a type of the fashion item. Close clusters are items that are
structurally similar (i.e. items that share information in the latent space). We cal also look at
this plot from a different perspective: the better our VAE model, the separation between very
dissimilar fashion items would be larger among their clusters!

Because the VAE is a generative model (as described above), we can also use it to generate new
images! Here, we will scan the latent plane, sampling latent points at regular intervals, and
generating the corresponding image for each of these points. This gives us a visualization of the
latent manifold that "generates" the fashion MNIST images.

```python
# generator that can sample from the learned distribution
decoder_input = Input(shape=(latent_dim,))
_h_decoded = decoder_h(decoder_input)
_x_decoded_mean = decoder_mean(_h_decoded)
generator = Model(decoder_input, _x_decoded_mean)

def plot_generatedImages(generator):
    # D manifold of the fashion images
    n = 15  # figure with 15x15 images
    image_size = 28
    figure = np.zeros((image_size * n, image_size * n))
    # linearly spaced coordinates on the unit square were transformed through the # inverse CDF (ppf) of the Gaussian
    # to produce values of the latent variables z, since the prior of the latent
    # space is Gaussian
    grid_x = norm.ppf(np.linspace(0.005, 0.995, n))
    grid_y = norm.ppf(np.linspace(0.005, 0.995, n))

    for i, yi in enumerate(grid_x):
        for j, xi in enumerate(grid_y):
            z_sample = np.array([[xi, yi]])
            x_decoded = generator.predict(z_sample)
            digit = x_decoded[0].reshape(image_size, image_size)
            figure[i * image_size: (i + 1) * image_size,
                   j * image_size: (j + 1) * image_size] = digit

    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
    plt.imshow(figure, cmap='Greys_r')
    plt.show()

plot_generatedImages(generator)
```

We find our model has done only a so-so job in generating new images. Still, given the simplicity
and very small amount of simple code we had to write, this is still quite incredible.

We can next build a more realistic VAE using `conv` and `deconv` layers. Below is the full code to
build and train the model.

```python
# input image dimensions
img_rows, img_cols, img_chns = 28, 28, 1
# number of convolutional filters to use

if K.image_data_format() == 'channels_first':
    original_img_size = (img_chns, img_rows, img_cols)
else:
    original_img_size = (img_rows, img_cols, img_chns)
latent_dim = 2
intermediate_dim = 128
epsilon_std = 1.0
epochs = 150

x = Input(shape=original_img_size)
conv_1 = Conv2D(img_chns,
                kernel_size=(2, 2),
                padding='same', activation='relu')(x)
conv_2 = Conv2D(filters,
                kernel_size=(2, 2),

                              mean=0., stddev=epsilon_std)
    return z_mean + K.exp(z_log_var) * epsilon

# note that "output_shape" isn't necessary with the TensorFlow backend
# so you could write `Lambda(sampling)([z_mean, z_log_var])`

# we instantiate these layers separately so as to reuse them later
decoder_hid = Dense(intermediate_dim, activation='relu')
decoder_upsample = Dense(filters * 14 * 14, activation='relu')

if K.image_data_format() == 'channels_first':
    output_shape = (batch_size, filters, 14, 14)
else:
    output_shape = (batch_size, 14, 14, filters)

decoder_reshape = Reshape(output_shape[1:])
decoder_deconv_1 = Conv2DTranspose(filters,
                                   kernel_size=num_conv,
                                   padding='same',
                                   strides=1,

if K.image_data_format() == 'channels_first':
    output_shape = (batch_size, filters, 29, 29)
else:
    output_shape = (batch_size, 29, 29, filters)
decoder_deconv_3_upsamp = Conv2DTranspose(filters,
                                          kernel_size=(3, 3),
                                          strides=(2, 2),

                             activation='sigmoid')

hid_decoded = decoder_hid(z)
up_decoded = decoder_upsample(hid_decoded)
reshape_decoded = decoder_reshape(up_decoded)
deconv_1_decoded = decoder_deconv_1(reshape_decoded)
deconv_2_decoded = decoder_deconv_2(deconv_1_decoded)
x_decoded_relu = decoder_deconv_3_upsamp(deconv_2_decoded)
x_decoded_mean_squash = decoder_mean_squash(x_decoded_relu)

# instantiate VAE model
vae = Model(x, x_decoded_mean_squash)

# define the loss function
xent_loss = img_rows * img_cols * metrics.binary_crossentropy(
    K.flatten(x),
    K.flatten(x_decoded_mean_squash))
kl_loss = - 0.5 * K.sum(1 + z_log_var - K.square(z_mean) - K.exp(z_log_var), axis=-1)
vae_loss = K.mean(xent_loss + kl_loss)
vae.add_loss(vae_loss)

vae.compile(optimizer='rmsprop')

# load the data
(x_train, _), (x_test, y_test) = fashion_mnist.load_data()

x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255.
x_train = x_train.reshape((x_train.shape[0],) + original_img_size)
x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255.
x_test = x_test.reshape((x_test.shape[0],) + original_img_size)

# train the VAE model
history = vae.fit(x_train,
        shuffle=True,
        epochs=epochs,
        batch_size=batch_size,
        validation_data=(x_test, None))

plot_train_history_loss(history)
```

Similar to the case of simple VAE model, we can look at the neighborhoods of different classes on
the latent 2D plane:

```python
# project inputs on the latent space
encoder = Model(x, z_mean)
plot_latentSpace(encoder, x_test, y_test, batch_size)
```

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/sadanandsingh/image/upload/v1567364021/autoencoders/img16.png)

We can now see that the separation between different class of images are larger than the simple MLP
based VAE model.

Finally, we can now generate new images from our, hopefully, better VAE model.

```python
# generator that can sample from the learned distribution
decoder_input = Input(shape=(latent_dim,))
_hid_decoded = decoder_hid(decoder_input)
_up_decoded = decoder_upsample(_hid_decoded)
_reshape_decoded = decoder_reshape(_up_decoded)
_deconv_1_decoded = decoder_deconv_1(_reshape_decoded)
_deconv_2_decoded = decoder_deconv_2(_deconv_1_decoded)
_x_decoded_relu = decoder_deconv_3_upsamp(_deconv_2_decoded)
_x_decoded_mean_squash = decoder_mean_squash(_x_decoded_relu)
generator = Model(decoder_input, _x_decoded_mean_squash)

plot_generatedImages(generator)
```

## Usage of Autoencoders

Most common uses of Autoenoders are:

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Dimensionality reduction was one of the first applications of
  representation learning and deep learning. Lower-dimensional representations can improve
  performance on many tasks, such as classification. Models of smaller spaces consume less memory
  and runtime. The hints provided by the mapping to the lower-dimensional space aid generalization.
  Due to non-linear nature, autoencoders tend to perform better than traditional techniques like
  [PCA][pca], [kernel PCA][kpca] etc.
- **Denoising and Transformation**: You can distort the data and add some noise in it before
  feeding it to DAEs. This can help in generalizing over the test set. AEs are also useful in
  [image transformation tasks][ref3], eg. [document cleaning][ref4], [applying color to
  images][ref5], [medical image segmentation using U-net][unet], a variant of autoencoders etc.

[ref5]: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08511.pdf
[unet]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597

- **Information Retrieval**: the task of finding entries in a database that resemble a query entry.
  This task derives the usual benefits from dimensionality reduction that other tasks do, but also
  derives the additional benefit that search can become extremely efficient in certain kinds of
  low-dimensional spaces.

- **In Natural Language Processing**

  - Word Embeddings
  - Machine Translation
  - Document Clustering
  - Sentiment Analysis
  - Paraphrase Detection

- **Image/data Generation**: We saw theoretical details of generative nature of VAEs above. See
  [this blog post by openAI][gen] for a detailed review of image generation.

- **Anamoly detection**: For highly imbalanced data (like [credit card fraud detection][fraud],
  defects in manufacturing etc.) you may have sufficient data for the positive class and very few
  or no data for the negative class. In such situations, you can train an AE on your positive data
  and learn features and then compute reconstruction error on the training set to find a threshold.
  During testing, you can use this threshold to reject those test instances whose values are
  greater than this threshold. However, optimizing the threshold that can generalize well on the
  unseen test cases is challenging. VAEs have been used as [alternative for this task][anamoly],
  where reconstruction error is probabilistic and hence easier to generalize. See this article by
  [FICO][fico] where they use autoencoders for detecting anomalies in credit scores.
